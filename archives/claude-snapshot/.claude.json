              "content": "The `~/.claude/settings.json` file is still officially recognized as a key configuration file for Claude Code on Linux, but the situation is more nuanced as of late 2025. Many users and developer guides describe `settings.json` as the primary place for global, user-specific settings such as permissions, model choice, and tool configuration. However, the legacy file `~/.claude.json` (not inside the `.claude/` directory) is also widely reported as necessary for some global settings to actually take effect, and this has created confusion in the community.[1][2][3][4]\n\n### Current Role of `settings.json`\n- `~/.claude/settings.json` is intended for personal, global configuration and should be used for overall defaults that apply to every project.[3][1]\n- Project-specific overrides are handled by `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` within each project directory.[1][3]\n- Some developers report that certain settings only take effect or can be reliably set in `~/.claude.json`, suggesting transitional, backwards-compatible implementation quirks remain.[2][5][1]\n\n### Migration & Deprecation Status\n- The documentation still references `~/.claude/settings.json` as the \"official mechanism\" for configuration, but community reports indicate ongoing migration pains and that some CLI commands (like `claude config list`) may not fully integrate with the file, instead managing settings in `~/.claude.json`.[4][5]\n- The CLI's `claude config` commands may not reliably pull from `settings.json`, reflecting a partial deprecation or disconnect between documentation and actual implementation.[5][4]\n- There is no evidence that `~/.claude/settings.json` has been fully deprecated—rather, it is situated within a confusing hierarchy where both it and the legacy `~/.claude.json` may be needed for full coverage depending on your workflow.[3][5][1]\n\n### Practical Advice\n- Continue using `~/.claude/settings.json` for user-level configuration.\n- If certain settings are not sticking, try duplicating them into `~/.claude.json` as a fallback, particularly for CLI-managed global settings.[2][4][5]\n- Project-level configuration overrides are best handled in `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` within your workspace.[1][3]\n\nSo, `~/.claude/settings.json` is technically not deprecated, but the configuration ecosystem is shifting and remains somewhat fragmented as of October 2025.[5][3][1]\n\n[1](https://www.eesel.ai/blog/settings-json-claude-code)\n[2](https://scottspence.com/posts/configuring-mcp-tools-in-claude-code)\n[3](https://www.eesel.ai/blog/terminal-configuration-claude-code)\n[4](https://ainativedev.io/news/configuring-claude-code)\n[5](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1202)\n[6](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings)\n[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1l24a93/claude_code_settingsjson/)\n[8](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5754)\n[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1l9qv09/claudemd_and_claudesettingslocaljson_being/)\n[10](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/8500)"
